# EXAMPLE EXPRESS API

I did this project to practice good practices in express development.

I will be updating this project as I discover new things.


## Version

### V2.0

I try to implement clean architecture in this project.
I didn't have to make many changes, fortunately.
I think using the pendency injection and keeping everything separate helped to avoid having to do a big refactor.

### V2.0.1

I try to implement a adapter for mongo repository.
For the moment I feel it is overkill. I feel that the previous version was more than enough.


## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Usage

```bash
# run
yarn dev

# run test
yarn test

#run test and watch changes

```
